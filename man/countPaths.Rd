\title{count paths between all pairs}
\usage{
countPaths(conf, maxLength = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{conf}{a matrix of conf.mat class. 
An N-by-N conflict matrix whose \code{(i,j)}th element is the number of times i defeated j.}

\item{maxLength}{a positive numeric integer indicating the maximum length of paths to identify}
}
\value{
A list in which elements are number of paths between all pairs of a given length.
}
\description{
\code{countPaths} Identifies the number of paths of length 
less than or equal to \code{maxLength} between all pairs
}
\examples{
# convert an edgelist to conflict matrix
confmatrix <- as.conflictmat(sampleEdgelist)
# find number of paths of length 3 or less
npaths <- countPaths(confmatrix, 3)
